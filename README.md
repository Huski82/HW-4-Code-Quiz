HW-4 Code-Quiz
The project was designed as a homework assignment to create a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The application uses Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct, this then generates a score and attaches a final page of results from the user data.
My homework is deployable as well I have a link below showing how it works.
